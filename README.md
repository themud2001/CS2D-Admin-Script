# CS2D Adminstration Script

Wanted to see my attempt in making one, and this is what I came up with.

I saw several adminstration scripts and how they're implemented and wanted to see how successful mine is, I know that there are tons of them found out there but making one myself doesn't affect. Despite that some codes are malformed, it gave me a bit of experience in Lua string patterns and in Lua coding in general. Anyways, I will be leaving this here if I or other people want to use it (talking about the ones that don't have vital sections of their frontal lobes, because proper homo sapiens won't use it).

#### Not the greatest of course nor the worst (I highly doubt that).
